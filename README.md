# 🌞 Summer School 2024: Time Series Analysis and Modeling

Welcome to the repository for **Summer School 2024: Time Series Analysis and Modeling**! This repository contains all the materials and code used during our session, where we explore advanced data science concepts, with a focus on time series forecasting using Python.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step tutorials and exercises.
- **`data/`**: Includes datasets used in the notebooks (e.g., `omni_full.csv`).
- **`models/`**: Pre-trained models and checkpoints for reproducing results.
- **`results/`**: Output files, visualizations, and model predictions.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## 🧑‍🏫 About the Session

This session is designed for students and professionals who are interested in enhancing their skills in time series analysis, neural network modeling, and data visualization. Participants will learn how to preprocess data, build and evaluate predictive models, and explore various extensions to improve model performance.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Correlation analysis and feature selection
- Building and training LSTM models for time series forecasting
- Evaluating model performance with various metrics
- Interactive visualizations and advanced model tuning

## 🚀 Next Steps and Exploration

Participants are encouraged to explore beyond the basics:
- Modify the time series window size for predictions
- Add new features (e.g., KP index) to the neural network
- Experiment with different model architectures and time series models
